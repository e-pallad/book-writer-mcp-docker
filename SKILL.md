# Book Writer MCP — Claude Code Skill

## Workflow for Starting a New Book
1. `book_init` — initialize project in current directory
2. `book_style_set` — capture voice, tone, POV before writing anything
3. `book_outline_set` — structure before drafting
4. Add key characters via `book_character_add` before Chapter 1

## Workflow for Writing a Chapter
1. `book_style_get` — always load style guide before drafting
2. `book_character_list` — recall who exists
3. `book_plot_threads_list` — check open threads to weave in
4. Draft the chapter content
5. `book_chapter_create` or `book_chapter_update` — save it
6. `book_continuity_check` — run before marking as review/final
7. `book_style_check` — verify voice consistency

## Workflow for Exporting
1. `book_stats` — confirm completeness
2. `book_plot_threads_list status=open` — warn author of unresolved threads
3. `book_export_docx` — compile final manuscript

## Important Rules
- ALWAYS load style guide before generating any prose
- NEVER invent character details — always check story bible first
- Run continuity check before marking any chapter "final"
- Keep synopsis fields updated as chapters evolve
